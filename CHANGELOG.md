# CLZ002 Changelog

**Project:** Claudezilla
**Current Version:** 0.4.5

## v0.4.5 (2026-01-06)

**Orphaned tab cleanup + support page optimization.**

### Features

- **Orphaned tab cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of tabs from disconnected agents
  - MCP server tracks agent heartbeats via command timestamps
  - Agents orphaned after 2 minutes of inactivity
  - Periodic cleanup check every 60s
  - All tabs from disconnected agent automatically closed
  - Freed space immediately available to active agents
  - Cleanup events logged to MCP server stderr
- **Support page layout** - Wider 2-column grid design
  - Container max-width increased from 500px to 900px
  - CSS Grid with cross-column alignment
  - All interactive elements standardized to 52px height
  - Responsive breakpoints maintained (768px tablet, 600px mobile)
- **Landing page spacing** - Hero section vertical spacing reduced (80px → 48px)

### Multi-Agent Safety

- Solves "ghost agent" problem where crashed/killed sessions hold tabs indefinitely
- Tab pool automatically recovers from disconnected agents

---

## v0.4.4 (2026-01-06)

**Fair multi-agent coordination.**

### Features

- **POOL_FULL error** - Agents can only evict their OWN tabs when pool is full
  - If agent has no tabs in pool, throws POOL_FULL instead of evicting others
  - Error includes owner breakdown (e.g., `agent_ec2e...: 7, agent_d99a...: 3`)
  - Hint guides agents to wait for others or request tab closure
- **MUTEX_BUSY error** - Screenshot contention now returns informative error
  - Shows which agent holds the mutex and for how long
  - Includes tab pool status and retry guidance
  - Prevents cascading timeouts during multi-agent work

### Multi-Agent Safety

- Tab eviction respects ownership - no silent stealing of other agents' tabs
- Clear communication when resources are contended
- Agents informed of contention rather than silently blocked or failed
