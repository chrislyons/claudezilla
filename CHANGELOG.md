# CLZ002 Changelog

**Project:** Claudezilla
**Current Version:** 0.5.0

## v0.5.0 (2026-01-06)

**Focus loops + Enhanced autonomy.**

### Breaking Changes

- **Terminology:** "Concentration loops" renamed to "Focus loops" across all documentation and UI
  - MCP tool names unchanged: `firefox_start_loop`, `firefox_stop_loop`, `firefox_loop_status`
  - Only user-facing text updated (descriptions, comments, documentation)

### Features

- **`/focus` slash command** - Skill wrapper for starting focus loops
  - `plugin/commands/focus.md` - Start iterative development tasks
  - `plugin/commands/cancel-focus.md` - Stop active loops
  - `plugin/commands/help.md` - Usage documentation
- **Auto-retry system** - Smart DOM element waiting with enhanced error messages
  - `smartQuerySelector()` with configurable auto-wait (5s default timeout)
  - `buildElementNotFoundError()` provides selector suggestions when elements not found
  - `findSelectorAlternatives()` suggests similar IDs, buttons, links, aria-labels
  - `click()` and `type()` now async with auto-wait built-in
- **Task detection** - Automatic detection of iterative tasks for focus loop suggestions
  - New `mcp/task-detector.js` module with `TaskDetector` class
  - Keyword matching: TDD, iterate, refactor, "keep trying", "fix until"
  - Behavioral pattern analysis: repeated test runs, file edits, error patterns
  - Scoring system with confidence levels (low/medium/high)
- **Auto-loop settings in popup** - UI controls for task detection behavior
  - Enable/disable auto-detect iterative tasks (default: on)
  - Enable/disable auto-start loops without confirmation (default: off)
  - Configurable default max iterations (default: 15)
  - Settings stored in `browser.storage.local` under `focusLoops` key

### Updated

## v0.4.9 (2026-01-06)

**Hotfix: Popup version display.**

### Bug Fixes

- **Popup version string** - Fixed hardcoded v0.4.5 displaying in extension popup
  - Users saw v0.4.5 in popup while running v0.4.8 binary
  - Popup now displays correct runtime version (v0.4.9)

### Notes

- No functional changes to error handling or browser automation
- v0.4.8 was shipped but popup showed stale version — this corrects that UI oversight

---

## v0.4.8 (2026-01-06)

**Critical error handling + comprehensive documentation.**

### Features

- **Error reporting for all content-script commands** - Agents now get clear error messages
  - `firefox_click` - Reports "Element not found: selector" when target missing
  - `firefox_type` - Reports invalid selector or element not found
  - `firefox_getContent`, `firefox_scroll`, `firefox_waitFor`, `firefox_evaluate`, etc. - All properly propagate errors
  - `firefox_getPageState`, `firefox_getAccessibilitySnapshot`, `firefox_getConsoleLogs` - Errors no longer silently dropped
- **Comprehensive documentation** - Global CLAUDE.md updated with complete Claudezilla reference
  - Full tool list organized by category (Window/Tab, DOM, Content Analysis, DevTools, etc.)
  - Performance hints (use getPageState over screenshot, mutex details)
  - Multi-agent coordination explained (mercy system, orphaned cleanup)

### Bug Fixes

- **Silent error suppression** - Background.js now checks response.success flag
  - Previously: Content script errors → undefined response.result → empty response with no error
  - Now: Content script errors properly thrown and propagated to agents
  - Affects 11 commands: click, type, getContent, scroll, waitFor, evaluate, getElementInfo, getPageState, getAccessibilitySnapshot, pressKey, getConsoleLogs

### Breaking Changes

- None - all changes are backward compatible (errors were previously silent)

### Multi-Agent Safety

- Agents can now reliably detect failures and retry with different selectors
- Full visibility into what went wrong during browser automation
- Essential for giving Claude complete control over Firefox

---

## v0.4.5 (2026-01-06)

**Orphaned tab cleanup + support page optimization.**

### Features

- **Orphaned tab cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of tabs from disconnected agents
  - MCP server tracks agent heartbeats via command timestamps
  - Agents orphaned after 2 minutes of inactivity
  - Periodic cleanup check every 60s
  - All tabs from disconnected agent automatically closed
  - Freed space immediately available to active agents
  - Cleanup events logged to MCP server stderr
- **Support page layout** - Wider 2-column grid design
  - Container max-width increased from 500px to 900px
  - CSS Grid with cross-column alignment
  - All interactive elements standardized to 52px height
  - Responsive breakpoints maintained (768px tablet, 600px mobile)
- **Landing page spacing** - Hero section vertical spacing reduced (80px → 48px)

### Multi-Agent Safety

- Solves "ghost agent" problem where crashed/killed sessions hold tabs indefinitely
- Tab pool automatically recovers from disconnected agents

---

## v0.4.4 (2026-01-06)

**Fair multi-agent coordination.**

### Features

- **POOL_FULL error** - Agents can only evict their OWN tabs when pool is full
  - If agent has no tabs in pool, throws POOL_FULL instead of evicting others
  - Error includes owner breakdown (e.g., `agent_ec2e...: 7, agent_d99a...: 3`)
  - Hint guides agents to wait for others or request tab closure
- **MUTEX_BUSY error** - Screenshot contention now returns informative error
  - Shows which agent holds the mutex and for how long
  - Includes tab pool status and retry guidance
  - Prevents cascading timeouts during multi-agent work

### Multi-Agent Safety

- Tab eviction respects ownership - no silent stealing of other agents' tabs
- Clear communication when resources are contended
- Agents informed of contention rather than silently blocked or failed
